🏦 Credit Card Approval Prediction using Machine Learning
This project demonstrates how to build a credit card approval prediction system using machine learning, similar to the systems used by real-world commercial banks. It walks through the entire process of data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and optimization using Python and scikit-learn.

📂 Dataset
The dataset is a subset of the UCI Credit Card Approval dataset, containing anonymized data about applicants and whether they were approved or not.

🧠 What the project does
Cleans and preprocesses raw data (handles missing values and categorical variables)

Splits data into training and test sets

Trains a Logistic Regression model

Evaluates the model using confusion matrix

Tunes hyperparameters with GridSearchCV for improved performance

🔧 Tech Stack
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

📝 Notebook Walkthrough
The Jupyter notebook is structured into:

Data Loading and Exploration

Missing Value Imputation

Encoding Categorical Variables

Feature Scaling

Model Training & Evaluation

Hyperparameter Tuning
