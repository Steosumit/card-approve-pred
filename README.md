# 🏦 Credit Card Approval Prediction using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates how to build a **credit card approval prediction system** using machine learning, similar to the systems used by real-world commercial banks. It walks through the entire process of data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and optimization using **Python** and **scikit-learn**.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset is a subset of the [UCI Credit Card Approval dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Credit+Approval), containing anonymized data about applicants and whether they were approved or not.

## 🧠 What the Project Does

- Cleans and preprocesses raw data (handles missing values and categorical variables)
- Splits data into training and test sets
- Trains a **Logistic Regression** model
- Evaluates the model using confusion matrix
- Tunes hyperparameters with **GridSearchCV** for improved performance

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

##  Future Features
- Expand the prediction to include alternative data sources (non banking) to make accurate prediction for subjects having less banking history

## 📝 Notebook Walkthrough

The Jupyter notebook is structured into:

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**
2. **Missing Value Imputation**
3. **Encoding Categorical Variables**
4. **Feature Scaling**
5. **Model Training & Evaluation**
6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
